The Theory of Cognitive Models  
(last updated April 26, 1997)  

---

Lakoff's [_Women, Fire, and  
Dangerous Things  
_](http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Bibliography.html\#Lakoff%20(1987))is a treasure trove of linguistic examples and  
a carefully developed model of cognition argued on the basis of semantics.  
His  
_experientialism_ places the human act of cognition in the center;  
his brilliantly presented result is that cognition is vitally dependent  
on metaphor, which he defines as a mapping of conceptual structures from  
one domain onto another--a result of particular relevance to literature.  

On the Relativity of Knowledge and  
Truth  

"Knowledge, like truth, is relative to understanding.  
Our folk view of knowledge as being absolute comes from the same source  
as our folk view that truth is absolute, which is the folk theory that  
there is only one way to understand a situation. When that folk theory  
fails, and we have multiple ways of understanding, or 'framing,' a situation,  
then knowledge, like truth, becomes relative to that understanding. Likewise,  
when our knowledge is stable and secure, knowledge based on that understanding  
is stable and secure.  
  
Is such knowledge 'real knowledge'? Well,  
it's as real as our knowledge ever gets--real enough for all but the most  
seasoned skeptics." (300)  

On the different kinds of cognitive  
frames  

Lakoff argues that experience is made possible and structured by _preconceptual  
structures  
_- "directly meaningful concepts" roughly the same for all  
human beings that thus provide "certain fixed points in the objective evaluation  
of situations". He divides them into basic-level structures and image-schema  
structures, and acknowledges there may be other kinds. Basic-level structures  
arise "as a result of our capacities for gestalt perception, mental imagery,  
and motor movement" and manifest as basic-level categories such as hunger  
and pain, water, wood, and stone, people and cats, and (perhaps more surprisingly)  
tables and houses (302). Image schemas are spatial mappings such as source-path-goal,  
center-periphery, and container. It is out of these basic cognitive tools  
that more complex cognitive models of reality are constructed:  

On literal and metaphorical meaning

The literal provides the building blocks of thought. "Cognitive models  
derive their fundamental meaningfulness directly from their ability to  
match up with preconceptual structure. Such direct matchings provide a  
basis for an account of truth and knowledge" (303). Since the matching  
is internal--from one concept or cognitive process to another--we do not  
run into the later Wittgenstein's problem of matching word to thing.  
  
The literal, however, cannot capture the order  
of all domains. "In domains where there is no clearly discernible preconceptual  
structure to our experience, we import such structure via metaphor. Metaphor  
provides us with a means of comprehending domains of experience that do  
not have a preconceptual structure of their own". Preconceptual structures  
are thus mapped from source domains onto target domains. This is a particularly  
elegant result, and fits loosely with faculty theory--although it is not  
clear that Lakoff himself would wish to make such an extension.  

Some examples of metaphors

- Life is a journey (the person is a traveler, purposes are destinations,  
    means are routes, difficulties are obstacles, counselors are guides, achievements  
    are landmarks, choices are crossroads  
    
- A lifetime is a day, death is sleep; a lifetime is a year, death is winter
- Lif is a struggle, dying is losing a contest against an adversary
- Life is a precious possession, time is a thief, death is a loss
- Time is a thief

What is striking when one examines Lakoff's painstaking lists of metaphors  
is how completely immersed we are in them, and how our thinking is enabled  
by them. It is perhaps impossible to say many things literally: there are  
simply no appropriate conceptual primitives. How, for instance, do you  
speak of the high points in your life literally? The very narrative assumes  
the metaphorical mapping.  

A critique and appreciation

Lakoff's approach of developing a general model  
of cognition on the basis of semantics has certain inherent weaknesses,  
in spite of its spectacular results. It cannot be taken for granted that  
semantic categories accurately represent cognitive domains--language may  
have access only to the output of other cognitive modules, and their domain-specificity  
may be partly elided by linguistic categories. For this reason, evidence  
for cognitive domains must be sought and demonstrated independently of  
language. However, semantics can be utilized as a way of generating hypotheses  
about domain-specificity, which can then be independently verified.  
  
The presence of cognitive domains also raises the  
question of how these came about. Lakoff assumes they flow out of our physical  
constitution and the nature of the world; a more precise way of speaking  
about this is evolutionary psychology. A consideration of the environment  
in which humans evolved would permit us to map the source domain onto a  
proper domain, and thus generate a more detailed list of properties and  
entailments. Such historical considerations would also allow us to provide  
principled answers to which domains do not have their own preconceptual  
structure: namely, domains that either did not exist in the ancestral environment  
(agriculture, most forms of technology, civilization) or domains that were  
not available or significant to survival (microbiology, quantum physics,  
chemistry).  
  
Moreover, Lakoff's notion of metaphor as a  
mapping from one cognitive domain to another as "one of the great imaginative  
triumphs of the human mind" has been echoed by the British paleo- anthropologist  
  
[Steven Mithen (1996)](http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Bibliography.html#Mithen%20(1996)), who  
has suggested that the transition from Neanderthal man to Cro Magnon is  
marked precisely by the ability to "switch cognitive frames": the paleolithic  
blossoming in art may be correlated with the ability to think metaphorically.  
  
Lakoff's proposal on metaphor is a particularly  
pregnant one for literary studies-- not because ordinary speech is mainly  
literal (it clearly is not), but because literature is a deliberate forefronting  
of linguistic devices, a cultivation of special effects. Clarifying what  
is the source and proper domains of a metaphor promises to throw light  
on the way meaning is constructed in reading. As for cultural studies,  
Lakoff's work opens up for the possibility of tracing political and social  
patterns back to an underlying set of metaphors (see  
[Lakoff  
and Johnson (1980)  
](http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Bibliography.html\#Lakoff%20and%20Johnson%20(1980)), [Brown  
(1988)  
](http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Bibliography.html\#Brown%20(1988)), and [Boyer (1988)](http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Bibliography.html#Boyer%20(1994))).  
  
It should also be noted that Leonard Talmy, whose early work clearly belonged to the Lakovian paradigm (see the next link), more recently has developed this approach explicitly in the direction of evolved cognitive structures (see [Talmy (1995)](http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Bibliography.html#Talmy%20(1995))).
