Everything is 
- Concepts themselves 
- It’s plane of eminence as a metaphor for the plateau we’re on — time, culture and place
- Delivered by the conceptual personae (that gives the work context) 


Transcendence vs eminence? 
- rejecting the philosophy of it 

*not the same as existence proceeds essence*
- but looks like the inverse though 

Ontology of eminence 
- univocal > one type of being (not a god vs us)
	- creation / emanation / expression can all be creating stories 
- Spinoza first thinker to write this down (and killed for it)

Based on Bergson’s theory of past exists in the present 
- confusing at times because we think in physical means (timeline visual) instead of as temporally (moments like now happening then)
- “an ontology that instead of reduce being to the knowable, but instead seeks to widen thought to palpate the unknowable” - todd may

Being instead of knowledge or truth … 

Superstructure > Marx theory that people who think through the lens of the economic state they’re born into 
^ Deleuze rejects this along with other post structuralists
