Description: Where my thoughts grow

> I'm afraid of losing my obscurity. Genuineness only thrives in the dark. Like celery.
~ [Aldous Huxley](https://www.azquotes.com/author/7118-Aldous_Huxley)

I'm trying out extending my [website](https://mbbroberg.fun) with a digital garden, which feels more aligned to my increasing preference for [[Rhizomes|horizontal organic growth]] rather than tree-centric metaphors. 

The site name is a play off "lossy" [[00 My Garden/00 My Garden/content/3 Resources/Mental Models]], which I am sure to reflect in my thoughts here. 

## Take a look around

I have organized most of my life around the [[PARA System]] and slowly doing the same here. I also have an evolving tagging strategy that [[Build a Digital Garden from Obsidian|plays off the nature theme]].
