### Continuous Learning

The people who inspire me: 
- [Melissa Perri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melissajeanperri/) - [her podcast](https://produxlabs.com/product-thinking) is my absolute favorite resource, especially when she answers questions in a "Dear Melissa" session
- [John Cutler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnpcutler/) - his [Beautiful Mess](https://cutlefish.substack.com/) newsletter helped me see myself as a fellow deep thinker product leader (and I subscribe via [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app) so I can read at my own pace)
- [Shreya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreyasdoshi/) - I love his principled approach and thoughtful summaries. He's inspired me to be clearer in my communication (he calls it "product editing")

The most influential people I keep an eye on (listening / reading some of their work): 
- [Silicon Valley Product Group](https://www.svpg.com) - a lot of great content from the 2010s that are becoming more common today 
- Lenny Rachitsky - also has a popular newsletter but I like [his podcast](https://www.lennyspodcast.com) the most

Essential history that filled in a big gap for me: 
- [The Collision of Product Management and Product Ownership](https://productcoalition.com/the-collide-of-product-management-and-product-ownership-439105363028)

Digging deeper -- this has an infinite amount of stuff to learn:

### Educational Resources

Specific to landing a product job:
- [Lewis C. Lin's 2 Week Product Management Interview Preparation Plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C56pX1Ilw6ZrqbN-33aPu2ezRCN5Q2yNzd1BvZqkhK4/edit#gid=0) helped me fine-tune my product thinking along with the books he lists in there (especially https://www.lewis-lin.com/decode-and-conquer)

Foundational: 
- [Inspired](https://www.svpg.com/books/inspired-how-to-create-tech-products-customers-love-2nd-edition/) (by the creator of SVPG)
- Lean startup

Advanced (and last I knew a core practice at Microsoft): 
- The Customer-Driven Playbook: Converting Customer Feedback into Successful Products


For books, I consider the following great foundational knowledge:

- Lean startup:  
      
    [ 
    https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005MM7HY8?plink=KiooiY7ufrgKWz4y&ref=adblp13nvvxx_0_6_ti  
    ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005MM7HY8?plink=KiooiY7ufrgKWz4y&ref=adblp13nvvxx_0_6_ti)
- Lean customer development for essentials of talking to customers to validate product ideas:  
      
    [  
    https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Customer-Development-Building-Customers/dp/B08VL4XRBY/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=lean+customer+development&qid=1613761407&sr=8-1  
    ](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Customer-Development-Building-Customers/dp/B08VL4XRBY/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=lean+customer+development&qid=1613761407&sr=8-1)
- Lean analytics for deep dive on metrics:  
      
    [  
    https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089XB8T3H?plink=Suy5zM6YOx4Zlzdp&ref=adblp13nvvxx_0_4_ti  
    ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089XB8T3H?plink=Suy5zM6YOx4Zlzdp&ref=adblp13nvvxx_0_4_ti)

  

The following is a deep dive on the approach we use  
in the developer division for researching and validating products (this  
is also a great primer for our interview process):  

- [https://www.amazon.com/Customer-Driven-Playbook-Converting-Customer-Successful/dp/149198127X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2FRDWBJ4AACT2&dchild=1&keywords=customer+driven+playbook&qid=1613761523&sprefix=customer+driven+pl%2Caps%2C234&sr=8-1](https://www.amazon.com/Customer-Driven-Playbook-Converting-Customer-Successful/dp/149198127X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2FRDWBJ4AACT2&dchild=1&keywords=customer+driven+playbook&qid=1613761523&sprefix=customer+driven+pl%2Caps%2C234&sr=8-1)

  

I also like this book from google, itâ€™s an alternative perspective on the design process with a lot of helpful ideas:

- [https://www.amazon.com/Sprint-Solve-Problems-Test-Ideas/dp/150112174X/ref=pd_sbs_18?pd_rd_w=mVlj1&pf_rd_p=409c42e8-023e-4951-9f77-4c63073a4537&pf_rd_r=SYJMCKSKSBVHQCYKGMBA&pd_rd_r=48515b8e-4b0e-4b72-bc2e-898980e08f87&pd_rd_wg=KNsKV&pd_rd_i=150112174X&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/Sprint-Solve-Problems-Test-Ideas/dp/150112174X/ref=pd_sbs_18?pd_rd_w=mVlj1&pf_rd_p=409c42e8-023e-4951-9f77-4c63073a4537&pf_rd_r=SYJMCKSKSBVHQCYKGMBA&pd_rd_r=48515b8e-4b0e-4b72-bc2e-898980e08f87&pd_rd_wg=KNsKV&pd_rd_i=150112174X&psc=1)
